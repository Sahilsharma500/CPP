/******************************************************************************
üîç Problem: Longest Arithmetic Subsequence
Platform: LeetCode
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-subsequence/

üßæ Problem Statement:
Given an array `nums`, return the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` 
such that the difference between every two consecutive elements is the same.

===============================================================================
üß† Approach 1: Tabulation (Bottom-Up DP with HashMaps)
===============================================================================
We define:
  dp[i][diff] = the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence ending at index i 
                with common difference = diff

We loop through each pair of indices (j < i), compute the difference (diff),
and update dp[i][diff] based on dp[j][diff].

This is preferred because we avoid recursion and stack overhead.

Time Complexity: O(N^2)
Space Complexity: O(N * D), where D is the number of unique differences

/******************************************************************************
üß© Why vector<unordered_map<int, int>>?
Each index i may have multiple differences leading to it.

So for each i, we want to map diff ‚Üí length.

Using a map allows us to efficiently:

Insert new differences

Extend existing sequences

If we used a 2D array like dp[i][diff], then we'd have to:

Handle negative diffs

Set up large arrays for all possible diff values (up to 2000 range)

‚û°Ô∏è Using unordered_map solves this cleanly and efficiently.

/******************************************************************************
üß† Approach 2: Memoization (Top-Down Recursion + Memoization)
===============================================================================
We define a recursive function:
  solve(index, diff) = max length of arithmetic subsequence ending at index with difference diff

This explores all valid pairs backward and stores results in a dp table.

Space Complexity: O(N * D)

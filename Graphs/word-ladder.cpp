ðŸ§  Problem Intuition: Word Ladder (LeetCode)
------------------------------------------
You're given a `beginWord`, an `endWord`, and a list of allowed words (`wordList`).
You can change only **one letter at a time**, and each intermediate word must be in `wordList`.

Goal:
- Find the **shortest transformation sequence length** from `beginWord` to `endWord`.
- If no such sequence exists, return 0.

Approach:
- Use **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** to explore all possible word transformations level by level.
- At each level, we try changing each character of the current word to all possible letters (a-z).
- We return the level (or depth) where we reach the `endWord`.

Why BFS?
- Because we need the **shortest** path, and BFS always explores all words of a given "depth" before going deeper.

Time Complexity:
- O(N * 26 * L), where N = size of wordList, L = word length
